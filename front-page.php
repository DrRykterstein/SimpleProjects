      This website contains a list of 10 simple web applications with varying
      degrees of complexity. These range from my very first project; a 
      profoundly elementary preview app which merely responds to a single click
      event, all the way to a full-blown memory game. Languages used for these 
      projects include a combination of vanilla Javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS.
